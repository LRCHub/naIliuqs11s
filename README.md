[00:12.89] Last night, I had this weird dream and you were there
[00:17.14] Standing inside this room I've been thinking about
[00:20.50] I can't remember if the place was real
[00:23.95] But, I was real and you were there
[00:26.66] And I was there for real
[00:38.66] 
[00:28.02] I could look but I couldn't touch there
[00:31.08] And then something was there between me and you but then
[00:35.08] There was something between you and me
[00:37.99] Like, do you get what I mean?
[00:41.01] (Do you get what I mean?)
[00:53.51] 
[00:42.31] It gives mе the creeps
[00:44.33] Sometimes I can't remember if I fell asleep or if I'm still awake
[00:49.30] And half across the street I saw you
[00:52.07] And I couldn't work out how to speak
[01:10.07] 
[00:56.13] Last night, I had this weird dream and you were there
[00:59.93] Standing inside this room I've been thinking about
[01:03.55] I can't remember if the place was real
[01:07.00] But, I was real and you were there
[01:09.51] And I was there for real
[01:21.51] 
[01:11.24] And it made me for real
[01:13.00] And it made it feel so real
[01:14.84] And it made me for real
[01:16.52] And it made it feel so real
[01:18.38] And it made me for real
[01:20.22] And it made it feel so real
[01:21.83] And it kinda felt surreal
[01:23.32] But, that made it feel so
[01:35.82] 
[01:24.63] Hey, I think I saw you in my dream
[01:30.32] And I know you don't know me
[01:33.94] But, could I get your number?
[01:36.08] Maybe, we could talk and make this for real
[01:57.58] 
[01:39.40] It just gets hard to tell if you're for real
[01:43.39] I'm more obsessed with you
[01:56.39] 
[01:45.69] Think of you sometimes
[01:48.66] And you could be the one that could taunt me in a dream
[01:52.24] And I wish you were for real
[02:06.24] 
[01:53.39] Try to keep my head from getting heavy
[01:56.54] And then rolling off my neck
[01:58.71] I keep forgetting because it's so hard to tell
[02:02.29] Today from yesterday or tomorrow, oh well
[02:22.79] 
[02:07.25] Lights in your room sync up with sounds from my cell phone
[02:11.02] I wondered what you'd do and if you'd feel up them
[02:14.83] Suddenly, I was climbing up through your window
[02:18.14] I'm such a klutz
[02:19.48] I fell and I died (oh no!)
[02:32.48] 
[02:21.44] Last night, I had this weird dream and you were there
[02:25.68] Standing inside this room I've been thinking about
[02:29.04] I can't remember if the place was real
[02:31.94] But, I was real and you were there
[02:34.79] And I was there for real
[02:46.79] 
[02:36.50] And it made me for real
[02:38.36] And it made it feel so real
[02:40.04] And it made me for real
[02:41.81] And it made it feel so real
[02:43.83] And it made me for real
[02:45.66] And it made it feel so real
[02:47.36] And it kinda felt surreal
[02:49.16] But, that made it feel so
